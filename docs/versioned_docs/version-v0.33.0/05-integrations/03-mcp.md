# Model Context Protocol Server (MCP)

Karakeep comes with a Model Context Protocol server that can allow LLMs (like claude and codex) to interact with your karakeep data.

## Supported Tools

**Bookmarks**
- Searching bookmarks (`search-bookmarks`)
- Reading a bookmark (`get-bookmark`, `get-bookmark-content`)
- Creating text and URL bookmarks (`create-bookmark`)
- Updating a bookmark (`update-bookmark`)
- Deleting a bookmark (`delete-bookmark`)

**Lists**
- Listing all lists (`get-lists`)
- Retrieving a single list (`get-list`)
- Creating a list (`create-list`)
- Updating a list (`update-list`) — name, icon, description, parentId, query, public; field constraints (length caps, smart-query validation) are inherited from the shared schema
- Deleting a list (`delete-list`) — child lists are NOT deleted with the parent; they keep their parentId pointing at the deleted list
- Adding and removing bookmarks from lists (`add-bookmark-to-list`, `remove-bookmark-from-list`)

**Tags**
- Listing tags with filters / pagination (`get-tags`)
- Retrieving a single tag with usage counts (`get-tag`)
- Renaming a tag (`update-tag`)
- Deleting a tag (`delete-tag`) — bookmarks that had the tag are not deleted
- Listing the bookmarks attached to a tag (`get-tag-bookmarks`)
- Attaching and detaching tags on bookmarks (`attach-tag-to-bookmark`, `detach-tag-from-bookmark`)
